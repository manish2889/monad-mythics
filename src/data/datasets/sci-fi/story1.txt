In the year 2473, humanity's last hope rested on the starship Nova-7, piloted by Commander Zara Kade. Earth had become uninhabitable after a catastrophic reactor meltdown, and Zara's mission was to find a new home on Proxima Centauri b. As the Nova-7 approached the exoplanet after a decade-long journey in cryosleep, Zara awoke to a distress signal emanating from the planet's surface. Her AI companion, Eon, warned of anomalous readings—energy signatures that matched no known technology. Against protocol, Zara decided to investigate, landing near the signal's origin. She discovered ruins of an ancient alien civilization, their technology still active, emitting a low hum. As she touched a glowing artifact, her mind was flooded with data—a warning of an impending invasion by a species that consumed worlds. With the artifact now bonded to her, granting her glimpses of future events, Zara knew she had to prepare humanity for a war they didn't expect. The fate of her species hung in the balance as she sent a transmission back to the fleet, hoping it wasn't too late.
