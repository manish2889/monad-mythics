In 1863, during the height of the American Civil War, Clara, a young nurse from Boston, volunteered to aid Union soldiers on the battlefields of Virginia. Amidst the chaos of cannon fire and cries of the wounded, she discovered a coded letter on a fallen Confederate soldier. The letter hinted at a secret shipment of gold meant to fund a desperate Southern counterattack. Risking her life, Clara smuggled the letter to Union intelligence, only to learn the gold’s location was near her own encampment. Under the cover of night, guided by a sympathetic freed slave named Jonah, she navigated enemy lines to find the hidden cache in an abandoned church. As Confederate scouts closed in, Clara and Jonah had to outwit them, using the church’s underground tunnels. They secured the gold for the Union, but at a cost—Jonah was wounded in their escape. Clara vowed to ensure his sacrifice wasn’t in vain, delivering the gold to turn the tide of a pivotal battle, forever altering the course of her nation’s history.
