I moved into a quaint, old house in a quiet neighborhood, seeking peace after a tumultuous year. The rent was unbelievably cheap, and the landlord seemed eager to close the deal. On the first night, I heard soft footsteps pacing outside my bedroom door. Thinking it was just the house settling, I ignored it. But every night, the footsteps grew louder, accompanied by faint humming of a lullaby. I set up a camera to record while I slept. In the morning, the footage showed my bedroom door slowly opening, but no one entered. The humming was clear on the recording, a melody I remembered from my childhood. Terrified, I researched the house's history and discovered a tragedy - a mother had lost her child there decades ago. The lullaby was her way of soothing her baby. I decided to move out, but on my last night, I woke up to the lullaby being hummed right beside my ear. The bed dipped as if someone sat down, and a cold hand brushed my cheek. I left at dawn, never looking back.
