My friends and I decided to explore an abandoned asylum rumored to be haunted. Armed with flashlights and a camera, we crept through the rusted gates under the cover of darkness. The air inside was thick with dust and the smell of decay. As we ventured deeper, we heard faint whispers echoing through the halls. Our camera started glitching, capturing strange orbs of light we couldn't see with our eyes. In one of the patient rooms, we found old medical records scattered on the floor. One of them had my name on it, dated 50 years before I was born. A chilling realization hit us - we weren't alone. Shadows moved in the corners of our vision, and the whispers grew into anguished cries. We ran towards the exit, but the corridors seemed to twist and change. When we finally burst out into the night air, panting and terrified, we realized our camera was gone. Days later, I received an email with no sender - it contained a photo of us inside the asylum, taken from behind.
