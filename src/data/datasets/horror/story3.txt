I was driving down a deserted road late at night when my car started making a strange noise. I pulled over to check, but as I stepped out, I noticed something eerie - there were no sounds of nature, no crickets, no wind, just an oppressive silence. I popped the hood and started inspecting the engine, but I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. Suddenly, I heard a faint whisper behind me, 'Need help?' I turned around, but no one was there. My heart raced as I quickly got back into the car and locked the doors. The whispering continued, growing louder, 'Let me in.' I looked in the rearview mirror and saw a shadowy figure in the backseat. I screamed and floored the gas pedal, driving as fast as I could. When I finally reached a gas station, I looked back, and the figure was gone. But on the backseat was a photograph - of me, taken from inside the car.
