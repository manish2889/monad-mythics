In the foggy town of Raven Hollow, Amelia, a grieving widow, moved into a decrepit Victorian mansion rumored to be haunted. She met Victor, a pale, enigmatic groundskeeper who tended the overgrown cemetery nearby. Their connection was instant, born from shared loneliness, as they spent evenings by candlelight sharing stories of loss. But Amelia began to notice unsettling thingsâ€”Victor only appeared after dusk, and mirrors never caught his reflection. One night, a chilling wail echoed through the house, and she found Victor in the attic, his eyes glowing, surrounded by spectral chains. He confessed he was a ghost, bound to the mansion after a tragic love affair ended in murder a century ago. Despite the terror, Amelia's heart ached for him, and she vowed to break his curse. Researching forbidden rituals, she performed a blood offering under a blood moon, nearly losing her life as shadowy entities attacked. Victor's spirit was freed, but in his final moments as a corporeal being, he kissed her, whispering he'd wait for her on the other side. Amelia lived on, torn between fear of death and longing for their reunion.
