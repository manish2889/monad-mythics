In the cursed realm of Grimhaven, where shadows whispered of ancient evils, a young mage named Lysandra sought the forbidden Grimoire of Nocturne to save her village from a creeping blight. Legends spoke of the book being hidden in the Obsidian Keep, a fortress haunted by wraiths of fallen sorcerers. As Lysandra crossed the threshold, the air grew cold, and ghostly voices chanted her name. Her magic flickered, weakened by the keep's malevolent aura, as skeletal hands clawed from the walls. She found the grimoire on a pedestal of bone, but touching it unleashed a spectral beastâ€”a dragon of pure darkness. Battling with spells that barely held against its terror, Lysandra glimpsed visions of her own death in its eyes. In a desperate act, she bound the beast to the book using a blood rune, sealing its horror at the cost of her own vitality. Though she escaped with the grimoire to heal her land, each night she now heard the dragon's roar in her dreams, knowing it waited for her soul.
