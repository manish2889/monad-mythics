In the 29th century, the arcane empire of Nexthar spanned multiple star systems, its citadels powered by eldritch reactors that fused magic with dark matter. Sorcerer-Engineer Veyra Thal was dispatched to investigate a breach in the Dreadspire, a space station orbiting a black hole, where experiments on necromantic AI had gone awry. Arriving with her cybernetic familiar, a raven forged from shadowsteel, Veyra found the station overrun by ghostly constructs—digital undead born from corrupted spellcode. The air hummed with whispers of the void as crew logs revealed a forbidden ritual had awakened an entity within the black hole, a cosmic lich feeding on data and souls. Veyra battled through corridors of flickering holograms and spectral claws, her spells glitching under the entity’s influence. Linking her mind to the station’s core, she cast a banishment rune through its quantum matrix, but not before the lich infected her familiar, turning its eyes blood-red. Though she sealed the breach, Veyra knew the lich’s essence lingered in her companion, a haunting reminder of the terror beyond the event horizon.
