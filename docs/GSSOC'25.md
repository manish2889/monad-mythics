## Contribution Workflow (Fork & Branch)

1. Fork the repository (do not branch from upstream directly).
2. Clone your fork and add upstream remote.
3. Create a focused feature branch per change set.
4. Keep commits atomic and descriptive (Conventional Commits optional but encouraged).
5. Rebase on upstream `main` before opening or updating a PR.
6. Open PR from `your-fork:feature/...` to `Drago-03/GroqTales:main` and fill the template fully.
7. Address review feedback promptly and avoid force-pushing unrelated rewrites.
8. After merge, sync your fork.

We are here to help you learn and build—welcome to the GroqTales community.
