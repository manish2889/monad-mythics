## General Questions

**Q: What is GroqTales?**  
A: GroqTales is a platform that combines artificial intelligence (AI) and Web3 technologies to
enable users to create, share, and monetize stories. Using AI, you can generate unique narratives,
and with blockchain technology, you can mint these stories as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the
Monad blockchain for ownership and authenticity. Learn more in
[What is GroqTales?](../What-is-GroqTales.md).

**Q: Is GroqTales free to use?**  
A: Yes, many features like story generation and publishing to the community are free. However,
minting stories as NFTs requires a connected cryptocurrency wallet and may involve small blockchain
transaction fees (gas fees), especially on the Monad Mainnet when live. Testnet operations are
typically free using test tokens.

**Q: Do I need a cryptocurrency wallet to use GroqTales?**  
A: A wallet is required for minting NFTs and may be necessary for publishing stories to ensure
authenticity. For basic story creation and browsing, a wallet might not be needed. Supported wallets
include MetaMask, WalletConnect, and Ledger. See
[Managing Your Account](../Managing-Your-Account.md) for connection instructions.

**Q: Which blockchain does GroqTales use?**  
A: GroqTales operates on the Monad blockchain, currently using the Monad Testnet for development and
testing. The platform plans to transition to Monad Mainnet for production use. This ensures
scalability and compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) standards.

## Story Creation

**Q: How does AI story generation work on GroqTales?**  
A: GroqTales uses advanced AI models (like those from Groq) to generate stories based on user inputs
such as genre, title, overview, characters, setting, and plot details. You provide parameters
through the AI Story Generator, and the AI crafts a narrative tailored to your specifications. Check
[Creating Stories](../Creating-Stories.md) for a detailed guide.

**Q: Can I edit or regenerate a story after it's created?**  
A: Yes, after generating a story, you can review and manually edit the content in the output area.
If it's not to your liking, click "Generate Story" again to create a new version with the same or
modified inputs. See [Creating Stories](../Creating-Stories.md#editing-and-regenerating).

**Q: How can I make my stories more unique or tailored?**  
A: Provide detailed inputs in the story outline section, including specific character traits,
settings, plot points, and themes. Adjust the "Creativity Level" slider under advanced options for
more experimental outputs (higher values) or structured narratives (lower values). Experiment with
different genres and prompts for varied results.

## NFT Minting

**Q: What does it mean to mint a story as an NFT?**  
A: Minting a story as an NFT creates a unique digital asset on the Monad blockchain, representing
ownership of your AI-generated content. This allows you to prove authenticity, showcase your work,
and potentially trade or sell it within blockchain ecosystems. Learn more in
[Minting NFTs](../Minting-NFTs.md).

**Q: How much does it cost to mint an NFT on GroqTales?**  
A: On the Monad Testnet, minting is free using test tokens (obtainable from a faucet when
available). On the future Mainnet, you'll pay a small gas fee in Monad tokens, typically a fraction
of a cent to a few cents, depending on network demand. GroqTales currently does not charge
additional fees beyond blockchain costs. See
[Minting NFTs](../Minting-NFTs.md#understanding-transaction-fees).

**Q: Can I sell or trade my GroqTales NFTs?**  
A: Currently, GroqTales focuses on minting and displaying NFTs within the platform (e.g., in the NFT
Gallery or your profile). Trading or selling features may be integrated in the future. For now, you
can list NFTs on external Monad-compatible marketplaces if supported. Check
[Minting NFTs](../Minting-NFTs.md#viewing-and-managing-your-nfts) for updates.

## Account and Wallet

**Q: Why do I need to connect a wallet to publish or mint stories?**  
A: Connecting a wallet ensures authenticity and ownership. For publishing, it verifies your identity
within the community. For minting NFTs, it's necessary to interact with the Monad blockchain,
assigning ownership of the digital asset to your wallet address. See
[Managing Your Account](../Managing-Your-Account.md#connecting-a-wallet).

**Q: What should I do if I lose access to my wallet?**  
A: If you lose access to your wallet (e.g., forget your seed phrase), you will lose access to your
GroqTales profile and associated NFTs, as accounts are tied to wallet addresses. GroqTales cannot
recover lost wallet access. Always securely back up your wallet's recovery phrase. For help with
wallet recovery, contact your wallet provider (e.g., MetaMask support).

**Q: How do I switch to the Monad network in my wallet?**  
A: When minting an NFT, GroqTales will prompt you to switch to the Monad Testnet if your wallet is
on a different network. Approve the switch in your wallet (e.g., MetaMask). If manual setup is
needed, add the network with Chain ID: 10143, RPC URL: `https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz`, and Currency
Symbol: MONAD. Details are in
[Managing Your Account](../Managing-Your-Account.md#switching-networks).

## Development and API

**Q: Can I build applications on top of GroqTales?**  
A: Yes, GroqTales is developing APIs for story generation, NFT minting, and user management,
allowing developers to create custom applications or integrations. Smart contracts on the Monad
blockchain can also be interacted with for blockchain features. See
[API Documentation](../API-Documentation.md) and [Smart Contracts](../Smart-Contracts.md) for
details.

**Q: How can I contribute to GroqTales development?**  
A: You can contribute by cloning the repository, setting up a local development environment, making
changes, and submitting pull requests. Follow the [Development Setup](../Development-Setup.md) guide
for setup instructions and the [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines.

**Q: Where can I find smart contract addresses or ABIs for GroqTales?**  
A: As GroqTales is under development, specific contract addresses and ABIs for the Monad Testnet or
Mainnet are not yet finalized. Check the repository for updates in a `contracts` or `deployments`
directory, or look for announcements in
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Drago-03/GroqTales/discussions). Details are in
[Smart Contracts](../Smart-Contracts.md#contract-addresses).

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Why does story generation fail or take too long?**  
A: Story generation may fail due to internet issues, server load, or incomplete inputs. Ensure all
required fields (like genre or overview) are filled, check your connection, and retry. If using a
custom API key, verify it's valid. Generation time varies based on complexity and server demand,
typically taking a few seconds to a minute. See
[Creating Stories](../Creating-Stories.md#troubleshooting).

**Q: What should I do if NFT minting fails?**  
A: Minting can fail due to wallet issues, wrong network, or insufficient funds. Ensure your wallet
is connected, set to Monad Testnet (Chain ID: 10143), and has test tokens (for Testnet). Check for
error messages in your wallet (e.g., "insufficient funds" or "transaction reverted") and retry.
Details in [Minting NFTs](../Minting-NFTs.md#troubleshooting-minting-issues).

**Q: Why can't I connect my wallet to GroqTales?**  
A: Wallet connection issues may arise if the wallet extension (e.g., MetaMask) isn't installed, is
locked, or lacks permissions. Install and unlock your wallet, ensure browser compatibility (use
Chrome or Firefox), disable conflicting extensions, and approve connection requests. See
[Managing Your Account](../Managing-Your-Account.md#troubleshooting-account-issues).
