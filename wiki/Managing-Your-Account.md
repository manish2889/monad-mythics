## üÜï Creating a GroqTales Account

Getting started with GroqTales is simple and quick. Follow these steps to create your account and
unlock the full potential of AI storytelling and NFT minting:

1. **Visit the GroqTales Website**: Open your preferred web browser and navigate to the GroqTales
   homepage (URL to be provided upon launch, or access via development links in
   [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Drago-03/GroqTales/discussions)).
2. **Locate the Sign-Up Option**: On the homepage, find the "Sign Up" or "Create Account" button,
   typically located in the top-right corner of the header or prominently displayed on the landing
   page.
3. **Choose Authentication Method**: GroqTales offers flexible sign-up options to suit your
   preference:
   - **Wallet-Based Authentication**: Click "Sign Up with Wallet" to connect a cryptocurrency wallet
     (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect) directly. This method uses your wallet address as your
     identity, requiring no additional credentials. Follow the prompts to link your wallet (detailed
     in [Connecting a Wallet](#connecting-a-wallet)).
   - **Traditional Sign-Up (If Available)**: If supported, select "Sign Up with Email" to register
     using an email address and password. Enter your email, create a strong password, and click
     "Submit." You may need to verify your email via a confirmation link sent to your inbox.
4. **Complete Profile Setup (Optional)**: After signing up, you might be prompted to personalize
   your account:
   - **Username**: Choose a unique username or display name for community interactions.
   - **Profile Picture**: Upload an image or avatar to represent yourself (optional).
   - **Bio**: Add a short description about yourself or your storytelling interests. Access these
     settings later via your profile dashboard if you skip this step.
5. **Access Your Dashboard**: Once signed up, you'll be directed to your user dashboard or homepage,
   where you can explore features like the AI Story Generator and NFT Gallery. Look for a "Profile"
   or "Account" icon in the header to revisit your settings anytime.

**Note**: Wallet-based authentication is recommended for a seamless Web3 experience, as it
integrates directly with blockchain features like NFT minting. If you use email sign-up, you'll
still need to connect a wallet later for full functionality.

**Tip**: Keep track of your sign-up method (wallet or email) for future logins. If using a wallet,
ensure you access it from the same browser or device where it's installed to avoid login issues.

## üîó Connecting a Wallet

Connecting a cryptocurrency wallet to GroqTales is a crucial step to interact with blockchain
features, such as minting NFTs and managing digital assets on the Monad blockchain. Here's how to
link your wallet securely and efficiently:

1. **Ensure Wallet Installation**: Before connecting, confirm that you have a supported wallet
   installed:
   - **MetaMask**: A popular browser extension or mobile app for Ethereum-compatible blockchains,
     including Monad.
   - **WalletConnect**: A protocol to connect various wallets via QR code scanning, useful for
     mobile users.
   - **Ledger**: Hardware wallet support for enhanced security (if integrated). If not installed,
     download and set up your wallet (e.g., MetaMask from [metamask.io](https://metamask.io)) and
     create or import a wallet with a secure seed phrase.
2. **Navigate to Wallet Connection**: In the GroqTales interface, locate the wallet connection
   option:
   - Look for a "Connect Wallet" button or icon, usually in the top-right corner of the header or
     within your profile/account settings.
   - If already signed in with a wallet, this button may display your connected address (shortened,
     e.g., "0x123...456") or a status indicator.
3. **Select Wallet Provider**: Click "Connect Wallet" to open a modal or popup listing supported
   providers. Choose your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect):
   - For **MetaMask**, clicking it will trigger a browser extension popup.
   - For **WalletConnect**, scan a QR code with your mobile wallet app.
4. **Authorize Connection**: Follow the wallet-specific prompts:
   - In MetaMask, select the account you wish to connect (if multiple exist) and click "Next," then
     "Connect" to grant GroqTales permission to view your address and request transactions.
   - Ensure you're connecting the correct wallet address if you manage multiple.
5. **Sign a Message (If Required)**: Some wallets or initial connections may ask you to sign a
   cryptographic message (a random string or nonce) to verify ownership. This is a gas-free action:
   - Click "Sign" in your wallet to confirm. This does not spend funds or execute transactions‚Äîit
     simply links your account.
6. **Verify Connection Status**: After connecting, the GroqTales interface should update:
   - The "Connect Wallet" button changes to display your wallet address (shortened) or a connected
     icon.
   - You may see a notification confirming successful connection.
   - Access to blockchain features like "Mint as NFT" becomes enabled if previously locked.

**Note**: Connecting a wallet does not automatically transfer funds or expose private keys.
GroqTales only gains permission to read your public address and request transaction approvals, which
you control via your wallet.

**Tip**: For security, always verify you're on the official GroqTales site (check the URL) before
connecting your wallet to avoid phishing scams. Never share your seed phrase or private key with
anyone, including support teams.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Managing Account Settings

Customizing your GroqTales account settings allows you to tailor your experience, update personal
information, and control preferences. Here's how to access and adjust your account details:

1. **Access Account Dashboard**: Log in to GroqTales and locate your account or profile section:
   - Click on your profile picture, username, or a gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in the top-right corner of the
     header to open a dropdown menu.
   - Select "Account Settings," "Profile," or a similar option to enter the settings dashboard.
2. **Update Profile Information**: In the profile tab, modify personal details to enhance your
   community presence:
   - **Username/Display Name**: Change or set a unique identifier for others to recognize you.
   - **Profile Picture**: Upload or update an image/avatar to represent yourself visually.
   - **Bio/About Me**: Write a short description of your interests or storytelling style (e.g.,
     "Sci-fi enthusiast crafting cosmic tales.").
   - **Social Links (If Available)**: Link to external profiles like Twitter or GitHub for
     networking.
3. **Adjust Account Preferences**: Navigate to settings related to platform behavior and
   notifications:
   - **Language**: Select your preferred language for the interface (if multi-language support is
     available).
   - **Theme**: Toggle between light and dark mode for visual comfort.
   - **Notifications**: Enable or disable alerts for story generation completion, NFT minting
     success, or community updates via email or in-app messages (if supported).
4. **Security and Authentication**: Review security options to protect your account:
   - **Change Password**: If using email authentication, update your password periodically for
     safety (ensure it's strong, with letters, numbers, and symbols).
   - **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: If available, enable 2FA for an extra layer of security
     during login.
   - **Connected Wallets**: View a list of linked wallet addresses. Disconnect unused wallets if
     needed (see [Disconnecting a Wallet](#disconnecting-a-wallet)).
5. **Privacy Settings**: Control how your data is displayed or used:
   - **Profile Visibility**: Choose whether your profile and NFT collection are public or private
     (if supported).
   - **Activity Sharing**: Opt in or out of sharing story creation or minting activities with the
     community.
6. **Save Changes**: After making adjustments, click "Save" or "Update Profile" to apply your
   changes. Some updates (like theme toggles) may take effect instantly without a save button.

**Note**: Not all features (e.g., 2FA, social links) may be available in the initial release. Check
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Drago-03/GroqTales/discussions) for updates on new account
management tools as GroqTales evolves.

**Tip**: Regularly update your bio and profile picture to reflect your current interests or
branding, especially if you share your NFTs or stories publicly. A complete profile builds trust
within the community.

## üåê Switching Networks

GroqTales operates on the Monad blockchain, and your connected wallet must be on the correct network
to interact with platform features like NFT minting. Here's how to switch networks in your wallet to
ensure compatibility:

1. **Understand Network Requirements**: GroqTales currently uses:
   - **Monad Testnet**: For development and testing (Chain ID: 10143, RPC URL:
     `https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz`, Currency: MONAD).
   - **Monad Mainnet**: For production use in the future (details to be provided upon launch).
     Testnet allows experimentation with test tokens (no real value), while Mainnet will involve
     real transactions.
2. **Check Current Network**: In your wallet (e.g., MetaMask), view the active network in the top
   dropdown or settings:
   - If it displays "Monad Testnet," you're already on the correct network for current development
     use.
   - If on another network (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon), you'll need to switch.
3. **Automatic Network Switch (Prompted by GroqTales)**: When performing blockchain actions (like
   minting an NFT), GroqTales detects if you're on the wrong network and prompts a switch:
   - A popup or notification will appear in the app, requesting to switch to Monad Testnet.
   - Click "Switch Network" or "Approve" in the GroqTales interface.
   - Your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) will display a confirmation dialog. Click "Switch" to change
     networks.
4. **Manual Network Switch (If Needed)**: If the automatic prompt fails or you prefer to configure
   manually, add or switch to Monad Testnet in your wallet settings:
   - **MetaMask**:
     1. Click the network dropdown at the top of the MetaMask extension or app.
     2. Select "Add Network" or "Custom RPC" (on mobile, go to Settings > Networks).
     3. Enter the following details for Monad Testnet:
        - **Network Name**: Monad Testnet
        - **New RPC URL**: <https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz>
        - **Chain ID**: 10143
        - **Currency Symbol**: MONAD
        - **Block Explorer URL**: (Leave blank or check
          [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Drago-03/GroqTales/discussions) for updates)
     4. Click "Save" or "Add." Then select "Monad Testnet" from the network list.
   - **WalletConnect**: Use the connected app or wallet settings to switch or add the network with
     the same parameters.
5. **Verify Network Switch**: After switching, confirm in your wallet that "Monad Testnet" is
   active. Refresh the GroqTales page if the app doesn't recognize the change immediately.
6. **Obtain Test Tokens (For Testnet)**: On Monad Testnet, you'll need test tokens for transaction
   fees (gas). Request them from a faucet:
   - Faucet details will be shared in
     [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Drago-03/GroqTales/discussions) or platform
     announcements when available.
   - Add tokens to your wallet address to cover minting or other blockchain actions.

**Note**: Switching networks does not affect your funds on other networks (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet
balance remains separate). Ensure you're on Testnet for current GroqTales features to avoid
transaction errors.

**Tip**: Bookmark or save the Monad Testnet configuration details for quick reference. If Monad
Mainnet launches, repeat this process with updated parameters provided by GroqTales to transition to
real-value transactions.

## üîå Disconnecting a Wallet

If you need to unlink your cryptocurrency wallet from GroqTales‚Äîwhether for security, switching
wallets, or troubleshooting‚Äîfollow these steps to disconnect safely:

1. **Locate Wallet Status**: In the GroqTales interface, find the wallet connection indicator,
   typically in the top-right corner of the header or within account settings. It may display your
   connected address (e.g., "0x123...456") or a "Connected" status.
2. **Access Disconnect Option**: Click on the wallet icon, address, or a dropdown menu associated
   with it. Look for an option labeled "Disconnect Wallet," "Log Out Wallet," or similar.
3. **Confirm Disconnection**: Selecting "Disconnect" may prompt a confirmation dialog to ensure
   intentional action:
   - Click "Confirm" or "Disconnect" to proceed.
   - No wallet signature or transaction is required for disconnection‚Äîit's a local action within the
     app.
4. **Verify Disconnection**: After confirming, the GroqTales interface should update:
   - The wallet status reverts to "Connect Wallet" or an unconnected state.
   - Blockchain features (e.g., "Mint as NFT") may become disabled until a wallet is reconnected.
   - If using wallet-based authentication, you might be logged out of your account entirely,
     requiring reconnection to log back in.
5. **Alternative Disconnection (Wallet Side)**: Some wallets allow revoking app permissions
   directly:
   - In **MetaMask**, go to "Connected Sites" or "Permissions" in settings, find GroqTales (based on
     URL), and click "Disconnect" or "Revoke Access."
   - This achieves the same result and may be useful if the app's disconnect button is unresponsive.

**Note**: Disconnecting a wallet does not delete your account, NFTs, or stories on GroqTales. It
simply revokes the app's ability to interact with your wallet until reconnected. If you minted NFTs,
ownership remains tied to your wallet address on the blockchain, unaffected by disconnection.

**Tip**: Disconnect your wallet when using shared or public devices to prevent unauthorized access.
Reconnect only when needed, and consider using a secondary wallet for testing if concerned about
security during frequent connections.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Account Issues

Encountering problems with your GroqTales account or wallet connection? Here are solutions to common
issues to help you get back to creating and minting without delay:

- **Cannot Log In (Email Authentication)**: If using email/password and login fails:
  - **Incorrect Credentials**: Double-check your email and password for typos. Use the "Forgot
    Password" link (if available) to reset your password via email.
  - **Unverified Email**: Ensure you've confirmed your email address via the verification link sent
    during sign-up. Check spam/junk folders for the email.
  - **Account Not Found**: If recently signed up with a wallet, try logging in via "Sign In with
    Wallet" instead of email.
- **Wallet Connection Fails**: If the "Connect Wallet" action doesn't work or errors out:
  - **Wallet Not Installed**: Ensure MetaMask or your chosen wallet is installed and unlocked.
    Install from [metamask.io](https://metamask.io) if missing.
  - **Browser Compatibility**: Use a supported browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) with the wallet
    extension. Some browsers may not support certain wallets.
  - **Permissions Denied**: If you previously denied connection, clear browser cache or reset wallet
    permissions in MetaMask under "Connected Sites."
  - **Multiple Wallets**: Ensure you're connecting the correct wallet address if you manage multiple
    accounts in your wallet.
- **Wallet Connected but Features Locked**: If your wallet shows as connected but NFT minting or
  other blockchain actions are unavailable:
  - **Wrong Network**: Verify you're on Monad Testnet (Chain ID: 10143). Switch networks as
    described in [Switching Networks](#switching-networks).
  - **Session Expired**: Refresh the GroqTales page or disconnect and reconnect your wallet to
    refresh the connection.
- **Cannot See My NFTs or Stories**: If your created content or minted NFTs are missing from your
  profile or gallery:
  - **Account Mismatch**: Ensure you're logged in with the correct account or wallet address used to
    create/mint the content.
  - **Sync Delay**: Wait a few minutes for blockchain transactions or story saves to propagate.
    Refresh the page to update.
  - **Filter Settings**: Check if gallery or profile filters are hiding content (e.g., showing only
    "Owned" vs. "Created" NFTs).
- **Error Messages During Transactions**: If wallet interactions (like signing messages) fail:
  - **Insufficient Funds**: On Monad Testnet, ensure you have test tokens for gas fees. Request from
    a faucet (details in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Drago-03/GroqTales/discussions)).
  - **Network Error**: Check your internet connection and ensure Monad Testnet RPC is accessible.
    Retry after a short wait.
- **Profile Updates Not Saving**: If changes to username, bio, or settings don't reflect:
  - **Save Button**: Ensure you clicked "Save" or "Update" after editing.
  - **Cache Issue**: Clear your browser cache or try a different browser/device to rule out local
    storage conflicts.

**Tip**: Document any error messages or unusual behavior (e.g., screenshots) for reference. If
issues persist beyond these solutions, reach out to the community for support via
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Drago-03/GroqTales/discussions) or check the
[FAQ](../FAQ.md) for additional insights.
