Define the task to achieve, including specific requirements, constraints, and success criteria.

# Task Definition

The task is to create a comprehensive project plan that outlines the steps needed to achieve the
project's goals. The plan should include:

1. **Project Objectives**: Clearly define the goals and objectives of the project.
2. **Scope**: Outline the scope of the project, including what is included and what is excluded.
3. **Timeline**: Provide a detailed timeline with milestones and deadlines for each phase of the
   project.
4. **Resources**: Identify the resources required, including personnel, tools, and budget.
5. **Risk Management**: Assess potential risks and outline strategies to mitigate them.
6. **Success Criteria**: Define how success will be measured, including key performance indicators
   (KPIs) and deliverables.
7. **Stakeholders**: Identify key stakeholders and their roles in the project.
8. **Communication Plan**: Establish a communication plan to keep stakeholders informed and engaged
   throughout the project lifecycle.
9. **Review and Approval Process**: Outline the process for reviewing and approving project
   deliverables, including who is responsible for approvals and how feedback will be incorporated.
10. **Post-Project Evaluation**: Plan for a post-project evaluation to assess outcomes against the
    initial objectives and identify lessons learned for future projects. The plan should be detailed
    enough to guide the project team through the execution phase while remaining flexible to
    accommodate changes as needed. It should also align with the overall strategic goals of the
    organization and ensure that all team members understand their roles and responsibilities. The
    final document should be clear, concise, and accessible to all stakeholders involved in the
    project.
