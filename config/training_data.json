Yet, as days passed, Luca's persistent charm and genuine curiosity about her favorite novels began to break through her walls.

Legends spoke of a golden idol there that could heal any ailment. Determined to uncover the truth, Maya assembled a small team and ventured into the uncharted jungle.

He enjoyed being outdoors in the mountains. Nothing seemed strange to him, that was until he was making his way back to his car. He figured an eight hour hike was good enough. The sky was already getting dark and he needed to get back, fast. What was odd was how much he didn't recognize the trail back. He began to panic.\n\nNight had already taken over and all he had was a flashlight and no clue on how to get back. He knew it was already too late and too dangerous to keep going through the perilous forest. He began to worry that he would have no shelter for the night when almost luckily enough, he stumbled across a broken-down cabin. It was dark, and seemed like no one had visited it in years, but he knew it was the only place where he could rest until daylight, especially since his flashlight was running out of battery. He knocked on the door a few times but no one answered, so he let himself in where strangely enough, a perfect bed fitted for one person awaited him in the center. He knew that if the owner came back he could explain himself, he was sure that the owner wouldn't mind, or was even probably dead. So he went ahead and got himself comfortable in bed. As he tried to sleep, he couldn't ignore the collection of paintings around the room; portraits of strange looking people all peering at him, each wearing a smile that sent chills up his spine. Not too long after his exhaustion from the hike got the best of him and he was able to ignore the faces.\n\nThe next morning he got up early and was shocked to see that there were no paintings around the room, but windows...",

I pulled over to check, but as I stepped out, I noticed something eerie - there were no sounds of nature, no crickets, no wind, just an oppressive silence. I popped the hood and started inspecting the engine, but I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. Suddenly, I heard a faint whisper behind me, 'Need help?' I turned around, but no one was there. My heart raced as I quickly got back into the car and locked the doors. The whispering continued, growing louder, 'Let me in.'

Our camera started glitching, capturing strange orbs of light we couldn't see with our eyes. In one of the patient rooms, we found old medical records scattered on the floor. One of them had my name on it, dated 50 years before I was born. A chilling realization hit us - we weren't alone. Shadows moved in the corners of our vision, and the whispers grew into anguished cries. We ran towards the exit, but the corridors seemed to twist and change.

On the first night, I heard soft footsteps pacing outside my bedroom door. Thinking it was just the house settling, I ignored it. But every night, the footsteps grew louder, accompanied by faint humming of a lullaby. I set up a camera to record while I slept. In the morning, the footage showed my bedroom door slowly opening, but no one entered. The humming was clear on the recording, a melody I remembered from my childhood. Terrified, I researched the house's history and discovered a tragedy - a mother had lost her child there decades ago. The lullaby was her way of soothing her baby. I decided to move out, but on my last night, I woke up to the lullaby being hummed right beside my ear. The bed dipped as if someone sat down, and a cold hand brushed my cheek.
