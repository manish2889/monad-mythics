## Repository Structure & Architecture

GroqTales is organized for scalability and modularity. Here’s a high-level overview:

```
GroqTales/
│
├── .github/              # Issue templates, workflows, configs
├── app/                  # Next.js app (pages, routing, layouts)
├── components/           # Reusable React UI components
├── contracts/            # Solidity smart contracts for NFT minting
├── lib/                  # Utilities, API integrations, helpers
├── public/               # Static assets (images, icons, etc.)
├── scripts/              # Deployment and automation scripts
├── test/                 # Contract tests (e.g., Hardhat/Foundry)
├── tests/                # Frontend/backend test cases
├── types/                # Shared TypeScript types/interfaces
├── wiki/                 # Project Wiki and guides
├── .env.example          # Example environment variables
├── package.json          # Project dependencies and scripts
├── tailwind.config.js    # TailwindCSS config
├── README.md             # Main project overview
├── CONTRIBUTING.md       # Contribution guidelines

├── SECURITY.md           # Security policy
└── ...                   # Other config and support files
```

**Architecture Notes:**

- **Frontend:** Built with Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui for a modern, responsive UI.
- **Backend:** Node.js API routes handle authentication, story generation, and blockchain
  interactions.
- **Blockchain:** Monad SDK and Solidity smart contracts manage NFT minting and ownership.
- **AI:** Groq API powers story and comic generation.
- **Database:** MongoDB stores user data, stories, and metadata.
- **Testing:** Jest/React Testing Library for frontend; Hardhat/Foundry for smart contracts.

---

## Coding Guidelines

- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Follow the Airbnb Style Guide.
- **React/Next.js:** Use functional components and hooks. Follow Next.js routing and data-fetching
  conventions.
- **Formatting:** Use Prettier (`npm run format`).
- **Linting:** Use ESLint (`npm run lint`).
- **Commits:** Use descriptive commit messages (Conventional Commits format preferred).
- **Docs:** Update docs and inline comments for all major changes.

---

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository (do not branch from upstream directly).**
2. **Clone your fork locally:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/GroqTales.git
   cd GroqTales
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Drago-03/GroqTales.git
   ```

3. **Synchronize before starting work:**

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

4. **Create a feature branch (use descriptive, kebab or slash style):**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/improve-story-generator
   ```

5. **Implement changes (small, atomic commits – use Conventional Commit style if possible).**
6. **Run quality gates locally:**

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run type-check
   npm test
   ```

7. **Rebase onto upstream/main before opening PR:**

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

8. **Push to your fork:**

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/improve-story-generator
   ```

9. **Open a Pull Request:**
   - Base: `Drago-03/GroqTales` `main`
   - Head: `your-username:feature/improve-story-generator`
   - Fill out PR template completely
   - Link issue with `Fixes #<number>` where applicable
10. **Address review feedback and keep branch rebased (avoid merge commits).**
11. **PR Merge Policy:** squash or rebase merges preferred; maintainers handle final merge.
12. **After merge:** sync your fork:

```bash
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

---

## Testing Guidelines

- Write or update tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Frontend: Use Jest and React Testing Library.
- Smart Contracts: Use Hardhat or Foundry for Solidity tests.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR.
- If unsure how to test a feature, ask in your PR or on Discord.

## Labeling & Tagging

To help maintainers and the community, **always tag your issues and PRs** with relevant labels:

- **Difficulty:** `easy`, `medium`, `hard`, `good first issue`
- **Type:** `bug`, `feature`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `security`, `web3`, `NFT`, `UI/UX`,
  etc.
- **Area:** `frontend`, `backend`, `blockchain`, `devops`, `database`, etc.
- **Programs:** `GSSOC'25`, `LGM-SOC`, `MLH`, `HackinCodes`, `cWoc`, `FOSS Hack`, `Indie Hub`, etc.
- **Status:** `in progress`, `blocked`, `needs review`, `help wanted`

**If you are participating in a specific open source program (like GSSOC'25), make sure to add that
label to your issues/PRs.**
